# 🔧 Specific Uses of White Clay (Kaolinite)

| Field         | Use                                                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ceramics**  | Porcelain, vitrified stoneware, technical tiling             |
| **Cosmetics** | Cleansing masks, talc, toothpaste                            |
| **Paper**     | Coating for glossy paper (enhances smoothness and whiteness) |
| **Paint**     | Filler in high-resistance paints                             |
| **Industry**  | Refractory materials, insulators, electrical isolators       |

# 🏺 Porcelain Composition (Typical)

- **Kaolinite** (pure white clay): ~50%
- **Feldspar** (flux): ~25%
- **Quartz** (stabilizer): ~25%

Fired at temperatures up to 1400 °C, this composition yields a **vitrified, translucent, highly durable material**,
resistant to acids and water.

# 🧪 Protocol: Purification of Natural Kaolinite (White Clay)

This procedure separates kaolinite from sand, silt, iron oxides, organic matter, and other impurities. The goal is to
obtain a plastic, fine-grained clay suitable for ceramics or laboratory use.

---

## 🛠️ Required Materials

- Collected raw kaolinitic soil
- Large plastic bucket
- Clean water (preferably rainwater or distilled)
- Fine mesh sieve (100–200 µm)
- Large transparent jar (e.g., 1L glass jar)
- Stirring stick or drill with mixer attachment
- Cheesecloth or cotton fabric
- Wide flat drying tray
- Optional: pH meter, iron removal reagent (oxalic acid)

---

## 🔬 Step-by-Step Process

### 1. **Slaking and Disintegration**

- Crush large clumps of soil manually.
- Add to a bucket and cover with water (~2:1 water-to-clay ratio).
- Let soak for 24 hours, then stir vigorously.
- Optional: Let stand 5 minutes and discard floating organic matter.

---

### 2. **Sieving**

- Pour slurry through a fine mesh sieve to remove sand, gravel, and plant debris.
- Collect the fine slip in another bucket.
- Repeat if needed to ensure complete removal of non-clay particles.

---

### 3. **Sedimentation Separation**

- Pour the sieved slip into a tall jar.
- Let settle for:
    - 1–2 minutes → sand settles (discard bottom layer)
    - 20–60 minutes → silt layer (optional discard)
    - After 4–8 hours → top layer = suspended clay (kaolinite)
- Carefully decant top layer into another container.

---

### 4. **Optional Iron Removal**

- If the clay is tinted (yellow/brown), soak in water with **oxalic acid** (2–3%) for 24–48 hours.
- Rinse thoroughly with clean water.

---

### 5. **Filtration and Thickening**

- Pour the purified slip onto cheesecloth over a sieve or colander.
- Let it drain slowly until it becomes thick and plastic (like yogurt or cream cheese).
- Alternatively, use plaster bat or absorbent surface to speed drying.

---

### 6. **Drying and Storage**

- Spread clay on a tray and allow to air dry slowly.
- Once leathery, knead to remove air bubbles.
- Store in airtight container or wrap in plastic for later use.

---

## 🧾 Notes

- pH of pure kaolinite should be between 4.5–5.5.
- Natural kaolinite has very **low shrinkage**, making it excellent for fine ceramics.
- This method yields **pure kaolinite paste** suitable for porcelain, cosmetics, or high-grade coatings.
